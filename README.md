# üí£ Minesweeper
A simple minesweeper game, currently only playable on Numworks calculator and coded in micropython  !

## ‚å®Ô∏è Inputs
The inputs you can do is the directional arrows to move your selection square in the all directions. After that, you can reveal the number of bombs around this box by using 'clear' and maybe put a flag with 'paste'. 
Just for fun, i added 3 buttons to choose the dificulty level with 'shift', 'alpha' and 'cut' which are respectively the level 1, 2 and 3.

## üìú Rules
All you have to do is find all the bomb by putting a flag on it or you can just reveal all others boxes without bomb to finish the game. You can reveal all the boxes around a box if you have discovered the right numbers of flags requested. That's all you have to know about it, so have fun and enjoy !

## üñ•Ô∏è Requirements
This program is coded in micropython just for Numwoks calculator but it must works on a computer if you change the module to adapt with Pyhton. But unfortunately, you also have to adapt the size of the boxes to your screen otherwise, it will be hard to see your game.

## üõ†Ô∏è Details
Unfortunately, it's in French, but there are not so many text so it won't be hard to understand.
